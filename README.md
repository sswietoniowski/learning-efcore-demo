# Entity Framework Core Demo

Small example showing use of [Entity Framework Core](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore), "code first" approach and semi-onion architecture. This sample was created for my own use during lectures, so nothing fancy here :-).

Please remember that to start this app, you have to:

- create database by using `Update-Database` (you might need to change the connection string to do that).

If you want to organized your solution a little better, you might need to watch [Clean Architecture with ASP.NET Core 6](https://youtu.be/lkmvnjypENw) [:file_folder:](https://ardalis.com/clean-architecture-asp-net-core/) or [Clean Architecture Example & Breakdown - Do I use it?](https://youtu.be/Ys_W6MyWOCw).

Interesting introduction to the onion architecture can be found [here](https://www.codeguru.com/csharp/understanding-onion-architecture/).

[Here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/modern-web-apps-azure/common-web-application-architectures) MS described different architectures and theirs pros & cons.

I would also recommend to watch [this](https://youtu.be/JubdZIdLQ4M) comparison video about different architectures.
