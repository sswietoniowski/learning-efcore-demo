# Entity Framework Core Demo

Small example showing use of Entity Framework Core, "code first" approach and semi-onion architecture. This sample was created for my own use during lectures, so nothing fancy here :-).

Please remember that to start this app, you have to:

- create database by using `Update-Database` (you might need to change the connection string to do that).
